    Shackle - Complex Input Validation

WHAT IS IT

  Shackle is a library written in PHP, to assist with building validation 
  schemes for complex forms - often consisting of many fields depending 
  on each other.

  Serialization to javascript is also a planned feature.
  Which will allow writing validation once, and apply it both client
  and server side.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

  * PHP 5.3+ because of it's extensive use of the namespaces feature.
  * PHPUnit 3.5+ is used to run the test suite.
